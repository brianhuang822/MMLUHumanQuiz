Loaded dataset of MMLU and put it into a page to let the laypeople to test their skill against the dataset

Code was mostly generated using GPT-4, was an experience to see how it did.

GPT-4 did a pretty good job minus a few bugs here and there which needed human intervention, but otherwise it let me make this site in 1 hour instead of 5 hours
